	  <p>The above links demonstrate a basic navigational structure using an
	  unordered list styled with CSS. Use this as a starting point and modify
	  the properties to produce your own unique look. If you require flyout
	  menus, create your own using a Spry menu, a menu widget from Adobe's
	  Exchange or a variety of other javascript or CSS solutions.</p>

	  <p>If you would like the navigation along the top, simply move the ul.nav
	  to the top of the page and recreate the styling.</p>

	<h2> Instructions </h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="mainbody">Be aware that the  CSS for these layouts is heavily commented. If you do most of your work in Design view, have a  peek at the code to get tips on
     working with the CSS for the fixed layouts. You can remove these
     comments before you launch your site. To learn more about the techniques
     used in these CSS Layouts, read this article at Adobe's Developer Center
     - <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/adc_css_layouts" >http://www.adobe.com/go/adc_css_layouts.</a>

    <h3>Clearing Method</h3> 
  </div>
  <img class="photo" src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRww1Qy2vE9INisz9etQJw06P3iZZzmoFFuNlseaxWiF_ocVwXm" alt="">
    <div class="mainbody">
      Because all the columns are floated, this layout uses a clear:both
      declaration in the .footer rule. This clearing technique forces the
      .container to understand where the columns end in order to show any
      borders or background colors you place on the nutellabun.container. If
      your design requires you to remove the .footer from the .container,
      you'll need to use a different clearing method. The most reliable will
      be to add a or after your final floated column (but before the .container closes). This will have the same clearing effect.
    </div>
    <div class="mainbodytitle">
      <h4>Logo Replacement</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="mainbody">
      An image placeholder was used in this layout in the .header where you'll
      likely want to place a logo. It is recommended that you remove the
      placeholder and replace it with your own linked logo.

      Be aware that if you use the Property inspector to navigate to your logo
      image using the SRC field (instead of removing and replacing the
      placeholder), you should remove the inline background and display
      properties. These inline styles are only used to make the logo
      placeholder show up in browsers for demonstration purposes.

      To remove the inline styles, make sure your CSS Styles panel is set to
      Current. Select the image, and in the Properties pane of the CSS Styles
      panel, right click and delete the display and background properties. (Of
      course, you can always go directly into the code and delete the inline
      styles from the image or placeholder there.)
    <div/>
    <div class="mainbodytitle">
      <h5> Backgrounds</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="mainbody">
      By nature, the background color on any div will only show for the length
      of the content. This means if you're using a background color or border
      to create the look of a side column, it won't extend all the way to the
      footer but will stop when the content ends. If the .content div will
      always contain more content, you can place a border on the .content div
      to divide it from the column.
    </div>
<footer>
This .footer contains the declaration position:relative; to give
Internet Explorer 6 hasLayout for the .footer and cause it to clear
correctly. If you're not required to support IE6, you may remove it.
